This was my final group project for Information Visualization at UVIC. The goal was mainly to practice creating a visualization, and we were told not to worry too much about the quality of the data so it may not be the most accurate.

The goal of this project was to see if natural disasters or large societal events affect the amount of coverage climate change receives from mainstream US media and whether the location of those events affect US coverage.

In this project I was responsible for:
- Choosing and processing the [natural disaster](https://www.emdat.be/) and [TV climate change mentions](https://blog.gdeltproject.org/a-new-dataset-for-exploring-climate-change-narratives-on-television-news-2009-2020/) datasets
- Creating the visualization in Plotly 

My partner was responsible for:
- Choosing and processing the social events dataset.
